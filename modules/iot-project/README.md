# IoT Project

The IoT project brings computing into the physical world where students imagine how computers may be embedded in everyday objects and use various input sensors and outputs to serve a valuable purpose. We will review the tasks for each phase of the project allowing you to try some the key activities as you consider your instructional approach.
