# Trivia Project

The Trivia Project provides a great entry point for students to learn about web applications and experience the industry-aligned techniques and roles filled in innovative product development. We will review the tasks for each phase of the project allowing you to try some of the key activities as you consider your instructional approach. 

The links below will lead you to the main page of the Trivia App Project guidebook. You can also browse the student work galleries to get a sense of what some of the major deliverables are for projects.
