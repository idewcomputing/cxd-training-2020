# Mapping Innovative Practices

![](../../.gitbook/assets/vidcoming-welcome.png)

We will map the **thinking, doing, and interactions of innovation** to provide perspective on the set of practices we want students to engage that provide a depth and breadth to their approach. We will investigate the **Indiana standards in computer science**, along with the **national framework** and **PBLWorks guidance,** to build confidence and comfort in covering a full spectrum of learning objectives.

### Prompts for Discussion \(on Slack \#cohort\*-module1-foundations\)

* How might you facilitate a _reflective practice_ with students to intentionally apply the different modes of thinking, doing, and interacting?
* Which of the practices discussed do you think will be most difficult to facilitate? Any potential ideas to improve outcomes?
