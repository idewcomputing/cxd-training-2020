# Mapping Innovative Practices

![](../../.gitbook/assets/vidcoming.png)

We will map the **thinking, doing, and interactions of innovation** to provide perspective on the set of practices we want students to engage that provide a depth and breadth to their approach. We will investigate the **Indiana standards in computer science**, along with the **national framework and PBLWorks guidance,** to build confidence and comfort in covering a full spectrum of learning objectives.
