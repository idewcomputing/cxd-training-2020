# Foundations

### **What is the** _**big picture**_ **of the Computing by Design \(CxD\) framework? How is it connected to fundamental concepts in science, design, and innovation? How can we introduce industry practices in a classroom environment?**

We will answer these questions and more through the following topics.

### \*\*\*\*[**The CxD Approach**](cxd-approach.md)\*\*\*\*

We will explore **primary learning objectives** for a computer science course and an achievable **student profile** that exhibits the attributes of a life-long learner and doer.  We will consider the **three threads of an innovator's work** and how we can use the classroom as a bridge for students to participate in the modern world .  We will review basic **industry practices to manage project work** and how to replicate them in an appropriate way for classrooms.

### \*\*\*\*[**Mapping Innovative Practices**](mapping-skills-and-practices.md)\*\*\*\*

We will map the **thinking, doing, and interactions of innovation** to provide perspective on the set of practices we want students to engage that provide a depth and breadth to their approach. We will investigate the **Indiana standards in computer science**, along with the **national framework and PBLWorks guidance,** to build confidence and comfort in covering a full spectrum of learning objectives.

### \*\*\*\*[**The CxD Project Framework**](cxd-framework.md)\*\*\*\*

We will go through the **three phases of a standard project outline** and discuss the primary activities in completing projects. We will review the important milestones of the **public presentations and deliverables**. We will consider how teams of students may progress through the project, sometimes in a linear series and other times in parallel tracks. Finally, we will see how students may develop **a product feature map** for organizing work and communicating progress.

### \*\*\*\*[**Programming Warm Up**](https://app.gitbook.com/@cxd/s/cxd2020/~/drafts/-M8REDYTusR9uw7LSsVf/modules/cxd-framework/core-programming-concepts)\*\*\*\*

We will cover some **basic concepts in programming with HTML and CSS** that can provide a launching point into our projects.

### \*\*\*\*[**A Teacher's Insight**](a-teachers-insight.md)\*\*\*\*

Justin Smith will provide insight from experience on how to facilitate innovation in the classroom.
