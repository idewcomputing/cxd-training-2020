We will explore **primary learning objectives** for a computer science course and an achievable **student profile** that exhibits the attributes of a life-long learner and doer.  We will consider the **three threads of an innovator's work** and how we can use the classroom as a bridge for students to participate in the modern world .  We will review basic **industry practices to manage project work** and how to replicate them in an appropriate way for classrooms.
