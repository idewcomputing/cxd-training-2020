# The CxD Approach

![](../../.gitbook/assets/vidcoming-welcome.png)

We will explore **primary learning objectives** for a computer science course and an achievable **student profile** that exhibits the attributes of a life-long learner and doer.  We will consider the **three threads of an innovator's work** and how we can use the classroom as a bridge for students to participate in the modern world .  We will review basic **industry practices to manage project work** and how to replicate them in an appropriate way for classrooms.

### Prompts for Discussion \(on Slack \#cohort\*-module1-foundations\)

* What do you see as primary roadblocks and opportunities for students to engage CS?
* How might you have students track project work? What methods have you used in the past?
* What code tutorial resource might you use? \(e.g. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all), [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)\)
