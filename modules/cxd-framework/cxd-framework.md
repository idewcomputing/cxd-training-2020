# The CxD Project Framework

![](../../.gitbook/assets/vidcoming-welcome.png)

We will go through the **three phases of a standard project outline** and discuss the primary activities in completing projects. We will review the important milestones of the **public presentations and deliverables**. We will consider how teams of students may progress through the project, sometimes in a linear series and other times in parallel tracks. Finally, we will see how students may develop **a product feature map** for organizing work and communicating progress.

### Prompts for Discussion \(on Slack \#cohort\*-module1-foundations\)

* What visual cues or weekly practices might you use to keep students and teams moving forward and aware of the broader context of their project work?
* What industry or community organizations might partner with you and your students?
