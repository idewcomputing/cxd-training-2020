# The CxD Project Framework

![](../../.gitbook/assets/vidcoming.png)

We will go through the **three phases of a standard project outline** and discuss the primary activities in completing projects. We will review the important milestones of the **public presentations and deliverables**. We will consider how teams of students may progress through the project, sometimes in a linear series and other times in parallel tracks. Finally, we will see how students may develop **a product feature map** for organizing work and communicating progress.
