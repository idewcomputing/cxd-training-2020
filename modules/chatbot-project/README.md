# Chatbot Project

The Chatbot Project challenges students to develop a conversational interface with a computer application, introducing them to concepts of artificial intelligence, decision logic, and natural language processing. We will review the tasks for each phase of the project allowing you to try some the key activities as you consider your instructional approach.
