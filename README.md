# CxD 2020 Overview

## Welcome!

**Welcome to the Computing by Design \(CxD\) summer training sessions for 2020!**This year's online sessions include four modules that introduce the CxD framework and practical projects that employ the framework. The sessions culminate with the construction of an instructional plan that facilitates computer science learning in your individual context. The [**base schedule**](schedule.md) spans the month of June, but you may choose to accelerate through faster.

## Primary Tools

We strive to make learning accessible with free and browser-based tools whenever possible, and that goes for these sessions as well. Below are the primary tools we will be using, and you can find links to an explanation of how we will use each tool, along with pointers on particular features.

[**Slack**](tools/slack.md), an industry favorite, will support our daily communication during these sessions. 

[**Zoom**](tools/zoom.md), a popular video conferencing platform, will be used for our live [scheduled discussions](schedule.md).

[**Google Drive**](tools/google-drive.md) provides a suite of valuable tools that most are already familiar with. 

[**Repl.it**](tools/repl.it.md) will be the go-to platform for most coding tasks. 

Each project may require other tools, but we will provide guidance for those when the need arises. Finally, we use GitBook to document our student project material and this training material to make it easily available, but you do not need to create an account to access it. 

## Session Modules

Each module will have a series of videos leading towards a module deliverable to share with colleagues. On our Slack workspace you will find  a _channel for discussion_ and _a channel for sharing deliverables_ with each module. You will also have options for live Zoom meetings according to [the schedule](schedule.md).

\*\*\*\*[**Module 1 : CxD Framework**](modules/cxd-framework.md) - We will cover the _big picture_ of the CxD framework, connecting it to fundamental concepts in science, design, and innovation. ****

\*\*\*\*[**Module 2 : Trivia Project**](modules/trivia-project.md) - The Trivia Project provides a great entry point into computing applications and the various activities and roles in innovative product development. 

\*\*\*\*[**Module 3 : Chatbot Project**](modules/chatbot-project.md) - The Chatbot Project challenges students to develop a conversational interface with a computer application, introducing them to concepts of artificial intelligence, decision logic, and natural language processing.

\*\*\*\*[**Module 4 : Internet of Things \(IoT\) Project**](modules/iot-project.md) - The IoT project brings computing into the physical world where students imagine how computers may be embedded in everyday objects and use various input sensors and outputs to serve a valuable purpose. 

## Instructional Plan

The sessions culminate by supporting you in the construction of an [instructional plan](instructional-plan/guide.md) that prepares you for facilitating a computing course in your unique context.
