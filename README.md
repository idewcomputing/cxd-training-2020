**Welcome to the Computing by Design \(CxD\) 2020 Summer Workshop!** This year's online sessions include four modules that introduce the CxD framework and practical projects that employ the framework. The sessions culminate with the development of an instructional plan for you to facilitate computer science learning in your context. The [**base schedule**](schedule.md) spans the month of June, but you may choose to accelerate through faster.
