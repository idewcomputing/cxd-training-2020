# Guide to Project Plan

Whether you are intending to run a single project as the main activity for a semester or inject a smaller project within another instructional context, you can use [**this template**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-VrDuWMlp4r6uCqIF1fx5NQlTjsBa_4TErhwKJYejc/edit?usp=sharing) ****\(embedded below\) as a starting point. You may also want to use \(or borrow ideas from\) the ****[**PBLWorks project planner**](https://my.pblworks.org/planner)**.**

If you are going to use a CxD project guidebook, a lot of the details are already prepared, but you definitely want to formulate the big-picture plan on you will facilitate the course in your context. Ultimately, make the project/course plan work for you and include the level of detail you need. We hope these resources are good starting points.

### **Recommendations on Template Sections**

#### **Description**

Provide a rich description of the project challenge and some background. What is the challenge to students specifically?  What technology or tools will be applied. What will be the make-up of student teams?

**Primary Student Resources**

List the primary material you will use \(like a CxD project guidebook\), along with programming environments and tools--like Google Drive, Prototyping Platforms, etc. 

#### Time Allotments and Project Management Process

Describe the intended time allotments for the major activities. For example -- 70% Project, 20% Individual programming tutorials, 10% Topic Research.  Also describe how you intend to manage team project progress, like with digital Kanban Boards.

#### Community Partners and Engagement Plan

Who in the community might be your partner? How do you intend the partners to engage with the students?

**Assessment Plan**

What will be your primary methods of formative and summative assessment?

#### Milestone: Date & Venue

What is your target date and place for student presentations?

#### Milestone: Publishing Channel

How might you make student artifacts available online for the community to see, either as a lead-up to a presentation or for those that can't physically attend? 

#### Milestone: Standards

Summarize the learning objectives and standards met with the work that leads up to the milestone.
